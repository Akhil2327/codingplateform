            <p>Welcome to the coding competition! Please read the following instructions carefully:</p>

            <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2">
                <li>You will have <strong>60 minutes</strong> to complete the test once you click the Start button.</li>
                <li>The test consists of multiple coding questions that you must solve.</li>
                <li>You can navigate between questions using the navigation panel on the left.</li>
                <li>Your code will be automatically saved when you switch between questions.</li>
                <li>There is no "Run" button to test your code - focus on writing correct solutions.</li>
                <li>Once you submit your test, you cannot make any further changes.</li>
                <li>Do not refresh the page or navigate away during the test, or you may lose your progress.</li>
            </ol>

A cable box connects to either one server (local) or two adjacent servers (if placed between them). You are to calculate the minimum number of cable boxes needed to connect all servers in the room if: Each server must be connected. Cable boxes can be shared between two adjacent servers only if they are in the same row. You must use the least number of cable boxes. Input: An integer M (number of rows) An integer N (number of columns). Output: Minimum number of cable boxes needed. ` },

You need to cover the entire square with square flagstones of size a × a meters. Flagstones cannot be broken or cut, and you can’t leave any part of the square uncovered. Determine the minimum number of flagstones needed. --- Input Format: A single line with three positive integers: n, m, and a (1 ≤ n, m, a ≤ 10^9). Output Format: Print the minimum number of flagstones needed to cover the n × m area. --- Sample Input: 6 6 4 Sample Output: 4. Example: If M = 2, N = 3 (2 rows, 3 columns of servers): We can connect each row like this: Row 1: [S]—[S]—[S] → use 2 cable boxes (between each pair) Row 2: [S]—[S]—[S] → use 2 cable boxes Total: 4 cable boxes` },

                { id: 3, title: "Question 3", description: `You are given an array of 3 positive integers: a, b, and c. You need to check if it is possible to multiply exactly one element of the array by a positive integer (≥ 1), such that the resulting array becomes an Arithmetic Progression (AP). An array [x1, x2, x3] is considered an Arithmetic Progression (AP) if the difference between consecutive elements is the same, i.e., x2 - x1 = x3 - x2. Return "YES" if it is possible to modify exactly one element of the array to form an AP, and "NO" otherwise. Input: An integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of test cases. Followed by n test cases, each containing an array of integers arr = [a, b, c] where: a, b, and c are positive integers, i.e., 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^4. Output: For each test case, return a tuple with: "YES" if it is possible to form an AP by modifying exactly one element of the array. "NO" if it is not possible. If the answer is "YES", return the modified array as the second element of the tuple. Example: Input: n = 3 arr1 = [5, 10, 15] arr2 = [3, 6, 8] arr3 = [3, 8, 10] Output: ("YES", [5, 10, 15]) ("NO", []) ("YES", [6, 8, 10]) Explanation: Test Case 1: The array [5, 10, 15] is already an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 5. Test Case 2: There is no way to modify any one element of the array to make it an AP. Test Case 3: 3*2=6 The modify one element of the array is 3 and it become AP [6,8,10]. Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 (Number of test cases) The array will always contain exactly 3 positive integers. Each integer a, b, and c satisfies 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^4.`}
